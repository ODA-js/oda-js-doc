# Introduction

Oda-js is composed of serveral parts: [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) code generatorts for server backend and for [Admin-UI](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/), set of runtime and developers libraries, demo projects.
It was created to make GraphQL developments more fun and productive.

## How It Works

You configure your appilcation schema and get the generated code for it. You can use it as boilerplate or extends it by this guide â€” do what ever you wish.

You always will get working code for your schema. It fully [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) compatible. It use [DataLoader](https://github.com/facebook/dataloader) for session state caching of you data. Pagination, Filters and more....
